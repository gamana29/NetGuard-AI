# Network Log Anomaly Detection

## Machine Learning-Based Network Log Anomaly Detection

A Machine Learning project for detecting anomalous and potentially malicious network activity using the NSL-KDD dataset. The project analyzes network connection records, performs exploratory data analysis, preprocesses network features, and applies machine learning techniques to distinguish between normal and anomalous network traffic.

---

## Project Overview

Network security is a critical component of modern communication systems. Large computer networks generate thousands of connection logs, making manual monitoring difficult.

This project uses Machine Learning techniques to analyze network log data and identify suspicious or anomalous network behavior.

The system processes network traffic records and classifies them into:

* Normal Network Traffic
* Anomalous / Malicious Network Traffic

The project is based on the NSL-KDD dataset, a widely used dataset for network intrusion detection research.

---

## Problem Statement

Traditional network monitoring systems may struggle to identify unknown or unusual network attacks. Manual analysis of large-scale network logs is time-consuming and inefficient.

The objective of this project is to develop a Machine Learning-based system that can:

* Analyze network connection logs.
* Identify patterns in network traffic.
* Detect anomalous behavior.
* Differentiate between normal and attack traffic.
* Visualize network security patterns.

## Dataset

This project uses the **NSL-KDD Network Intrusion Detection Dataset**.

The dataset contains network connection records with multiple features describing network traffic behavior.

### Dataset Files

```text
data/
├── KDDTrain+.TXT
└── KDDTest+.TXT
```

### Dataset Features

The dataset contains:

* 41 network traffic features
* 1 attack label
* 1 difficulty level

Important features include:

| Feature       | Description                                |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| duration      | Length of network connection               |
| protocol_type | Network protocol such as TCP, UDP, or ICMP |
| service       | Network service such as HTTP, FTP, or SSH  |
| flag          | Connection status flag                     |
| src_bytes     | Bytes sent from source                     |
| dst_bytes     | Bytes received by destination              |
| count         | Number of connections to the same host     |
| srv_count     | Number of connections to the same service  |
| serror_rate   | Connection error rate                      |
| rerror_rate   | Rejected connection rate                   |
| label         | Network traffic attack category            |

## Attack Types

The NSL-KDD dataset contains normal traffic and multiple network attack categories.

Some examples include:

```text
normal
neptune
satan
ipsweep
portsweep
smurf
nmap
back
teardrop
warezclient
guess_passwd
buffer_overflow
rootkit
```

For anomaly detection, the labels are converted into binary classes:

| Value | Meaning                    |
| ----- | -------------------------- |
| 0     | Normal Traffic             |
| 1     | Anomalous / Attack Traffic |
